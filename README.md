Cookbook to install and configure Gerrit Code Review

For most, the default attributes should be sufficient to get
a working Gerrit install up and running in no time. The cookbook
does assume that you will be using MySQL as your backing database
and does not currently support other DB backends.

Platforms
=========

This cookbook was built and tested on CentOS 6.3 and RHEL 6.4, but
it will most likely work on other platforms. It utilizes many
of the OpsCode cookbooks which have fairly good cross-platform support.
